            <h3>Online Invoicing Laboratory</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p align="justify" ><strong>This is my Java final project for Software Development Academy exam, with the theme of online invoicin for companies, from
                different countries.</strong></p>
            <strong>It is developed in IntelliJ IDEA from Jetbreans, using Java programming language JDK1.8, Maven and JPA repositories, Spring MVC and SpringBoot frameworks for back-end, and
                HTML, CSS, JavaScript programming language, Thymeleaf, Bootsrtrap for front-end. I also used Jaspersoft for creating PDF and HTML reports.</strong><br>
            <strong>The database is written in SQL Workbench.</strong><br>
            <strong>The invoices are generated by a company that sells the on-line app to its
                companies'clients.</strong><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>The project have different tasks, such as:</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Management of users with different roles;</li>
                <li>Add, edit or delete a company (a user);</li>
                <li>Add, edit or delete invoices and payments by the users;</li>
                <li>Add, edit or delete clients for each user;</li>
                <li>Add, edit or delete products and services provided by the user;</li>
                <li>Generate reports and statistics for the user (company) for issued invoices, products/services sold,
                    payments in total invoices or for each client, most sold products or services etc.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <strong>The project will have different tables with different relationship among them, such as:</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Users;</li>
                <li>Clients;</li>
                <li>Products/services;</li>
                <li>Invoices;</li>
                <li>Lines of invoices;</li>
                <li>Payments</li>
                <li>Authorities</li>
                <br>
                <strong>and static tabels, such as:</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li>City;</li>
                <li>Country;</li>
                <li>User type;</li>
                <li>Product type;</li>
                <li>Unit type;</li>
                <li>Payment type;</li>
                <br></ol>
            <strong>Note: The list of relational tables and entities is not final, because it can be modified for the
                users' purposes.</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>The Maven project will use JPA repositories, HTML templates and CSS styles and
                will provide an on line template for issuing invoices by the signed in users, to their clients,
                along with payments and providing reports for analysis of
                the past activities in order to take better decisions in the future and see the market trends.</strong>
